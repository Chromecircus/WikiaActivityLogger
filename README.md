# WikiaActivityLogger
A simple tool for logging activity of a [Wikia](http://community.wikia.com) wiki through several transports (currently only supported transport is [Discord](https://discordapp.com)).
## TODO
- Better fetch system? Like really, polling isn't a good idea at all but I've no idea what other to use
- Stability and stuff
- Abuse log
- Special:Newwikis if we're logging Community Central? Idk
